# Web-Terminal Contribution Guidelines
We really appreciate your interest in our project! If you're looking to add your own contributions, we ask that you do so according to the following guidelines:

## Reporting a Bug
  * Please check that the bug has not already been reported by searching our [Github Issues page](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues). 
  * If the bug has already been reported and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
  * If there is no existing issue which addresses this bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). The more information and context you provide with regards to the problem you are facing, the easier it will be for us to work towards a solution.
    * Give the issue a clear and descriptive title that identifies the problem.
    * Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem, including as many relevant details as possible. 
      * If possible, provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps (e.g. code sample or test case).
    * Describe the problematic behavior you observed after following the steps and how it differed from the behavior you expected to see.
      * Include screenshots, error messages, etc. that help demonstrate the problem.

## Fixing a Bug
 * If you have written a patch that fixes a bug, please open a [new GitHub pull request](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/compare) with the patch. 
 * In the PR description, clearly describe both the problem and your solution. If this fix addresses a reported issue, please include the relevant issue number in the description.
 
## Suggesting Feature Enhancements: Adding a New Feature or Changing an Existing One
  * Suggestions for enhancing Web-Terminal, whether it be to create a completely new feature, or to improve an existing one are tracked as GitHub Issues. Please check that the same enhancement has not already been suggested by searching our [Github Issues page](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues).
  * If the same or very similar enhancement has been previously suggested, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. 
  * If there is no existing issue related to your feature suggestion, [create a new issue](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) with the following information included: 
    * Give the issue a clear and descriptive title that identifies your suggestion.
    * Adding a new feature: provide a detailed description of what functionality and behavior it would have and how its implementation would benefit the project. 
    * Improving an existing feature: provide a description of the current functionality of that feature, what aspect of that feature you would like to change and why, and a detailed description of the improved functionality/behavior this feature enhancement would provide.
    * Whenever possible, provide specific steps that could be taken to implement these feature enhancements. 
    * Include screenshots or other media examples to demonstrate your idea visually or to demonstrate the aspect of Web-Terminal which your suggestion is related to.
   * If you want to be the one to implement your suggested enhancement, start writing code!
   
## Implementing Feature Enhancements: Adding a New Feature or Changing an Existing One
 * If you have written code to either add a new feature to Web-Terminal or to improve one of its existing features, please open a [new GitHub pull request](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/compare) with your new code.
   * Note: To implement a feature enhancement, we ask that this enhancement first be suggested as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) for tracking purposes. If the issue does not already exist on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/danielle-galvao/web-terminal/issues), please follow the [above guidelines to suggest a feature enhancement] (#suggesting-feature-enhancements:-adding-a-new-feature-or-changing-an-existing-one), before returning to this implementation step. If an issue for this feature enhancement has already been created, you may continue with implementation. 
 * In the PR description:
   * Include the relevant issue number for the issue that your changes address.
   * Adding a new feature: Clearly describe the functionality and behavior of this new feature, providing as much detail and as many examples (images, specific use cases, etc.) as possible. Describe the major steps you took to implement this feature, how it benefits the project, as well as any potential drawbacks its addition could have. 
   * Improving an existing feature: Clearly describe the functionality and behavior of this improved feature and exactly how it differs from the functionality and behavior of the previously existing behavior. Provide as much detail and as many examples of the improved functionality (images, specific use cases, etc.) as possible. Describe the steps you took to change this feature, how the change improves upon the previous existing feature, as well as any potential drawbacks associated with this change.
