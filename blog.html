<h2>Our Project Vision: February 2020</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our Open Source Web Terminal Project site! Our goal for this project is to design and create a user-friendly terminal emulator, keeping in mind the person behind the screen as we develop each aspect along the way.
<br><br>
Furthermore, for the experienced programmer, the tedious commands, absence of shortcuts, and the generally "user-hostile" environment which the terminal provides can be not only frustrating but can actually inhibit productivity. The tech world is all about shortcuts and efficiency, yet the terminal we employ to do so much of our work is majorly lacking in these areas.
<br><br>
Our project's aim is to create a terminal that might actually be enjoyable to use - one that has an aesthetically pleasing interface and tools to make life easier. Tools including pop-up man pages so you can quickly and easily remind yourself how to use a command, the ability to view image thumbnails when you call the ls command, breakpoint additions to pipelines, macros for the last path you typed in, and more. Any aspect of the terminal that makes you grumble as you work is an aspect we'd like to fix!
