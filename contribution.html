<h1>Contribution</h1>

<p>
    Have you ever been using a terminal and thought, "Wow, it would be really convenient if I could ...?"
    <br>
    Now, with Web-Terminal, you can create this functionality!
    <br>
    Our goal is to create a terminal on training wheels, one is as user friendly as possible, and with your help we can make this happen. 
    <br><br>
    Don't have an idea, but still want to contribute? Below is a current list of issues and improvements which have been identified and would be great for you to take on!

var i;

for (i = 0; i < coll.length; i++) {
  coll[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
    this.classList.toggle("active");
    var content = this.nextElementSibling;
    if (content.style.display === "block") {
      content.style.display = "none";
    } else {
      content.style.display = "block";
    }
  });
