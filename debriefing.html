<h1>Project Debriefing</h1>
<h2> Milestone 5: April 30, 2020 </h2>

<p>
Over the past several months, we have created Web-Terminal, our group's open source project. We have gone through the steps of setting up the project for development, building a product from our ideas, and releasing it to the public, opening our project up to outside contribution. Creating this open-source project has been a unique learning experience for each of us, full of challenges and rewards.
