<h1>Our Initial Prototype</h1>
<h2> Milestone 3: March 2, 2020 </h2>

<p>
Over the past several weeks, we have created an initial minimum viable product that implements at a very basic
level the major features that we previously identified as being goals for our project.
<br><br>
Throughout this time, as we continued to discuss what our overall aim for our project is, we settled on the phrase "Terminal on Training Wheels"
as being a solid description of what we're working towards creating.
We want to create a product that makes life easier for a user at any level, but the tools we're implementing could be especially
helpful in allowing newer users to focus on their work as programmers as opposed to the complexities and inconveniences of the terminal with which they're programming.
We decided to have our terminal interface be browser-based, allowing us great customizability as well as providing ease of use.
We also decided to embody the phrase "Terminal on Training Wheels" as part of our branding, creating our logo with this idea in mind.

Here is a visual preview of the major features we have chosen to implement as displayed in the browser:
